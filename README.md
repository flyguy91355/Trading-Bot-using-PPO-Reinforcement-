Trading Bot with PPO Reinforcement Learning
Overview
This project implements a reinforcement learning-based trading bot using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from Stable Baselines3. It fetches historical stock or cryptocurrency data via yfinance (no API key required), simulates trading in a custom Gymnasium environment, and provides a user-friendly Tkinter GUI for training, testing, and visualization.
Key enhancements include:

Technical indicators like RSI (via the ta library).
Risk management with configurable stop-loss thresholds and trade costs (e.g., commissions).
Continued training from saved models.
Hyperparameter tuning support via Optuna (optional).
Stub for live paper trading using Alpaca (optional, requires API keys).
Visualization with Matplotlib: Price charts with buy/sell signals and equity curves.
Benchmarking against buy-and-hold strategies.

The bot models trading as a Markov Decision Process:

State: Normalized closing prices over a lookback window + optional RSI + portfolio metrics (balance, shares, net worth).
Actions: Discrete (Hold, Buy, Sell).
Rewards: Portfolio value change, penalized for stop-loss triggers and trade costs.

This is for educational and backtesting purposes only. Trading involves significant risk; do not use for real investments without professional validation and compliance with regulations.
Features

Data Fetching: Supports stocks (e.g., AAPL) and crypto (e.g., BTC-USD) from Yahoo Finance. Auto-fixes symbols (e.g., BTC_USD → BTC-USD).
Custom Environment: Gymnasium-compatible with RSI integration, stop-loss, and fractional shares for realistic trading.
Training & Testing: PPO agent with TensorBoard logging; supports resuming from saved models. Test on full dataset with metrics.
GUI Interface: Tkinter app for parameter tuning (symbol, dates, balance, timesteps, RSI, trade cost), data fetching, training, testing, model save/load, and non-blocking plotting.
Optional Modules:

RSI indicator (requires ta).
Hyperparameter optimization (requires optuna).
Live trading stub (requires alpaca-py and API keys).


Performance Metrics: Return %, trades count, action distribution, outperformance vs. buy-and-hold.
Threading: Non-blocking GUI for long-running tasks like training.
Plotting: Generates charts showing price with buy/sell markers and portfolio equity curve.

Installation


Clone the Repository:
text
git clone https://github.com/flyguy91355/Trading-Bot-using-PPO-Reinforcement-.git
cd trading-bot-ppo


Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):
text
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
text
pip install -r requirements.txt

Core: yfinance, pandas, numpy, gymnasium, stable-baselines3[extra], torch.
Optional: ta (RSI), optuna (tuning), alpaca-py (live trading), websockets (Alpaca streaming).
Visualization: matplotlib.

Note: Requires Python 3.9+. Tkinter is stdlib (on Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk).


For Live Trading (Optional):

Sign up for Alpaca (paper trading recommended).
Set env vars: export APCA_API_KEY_ID=your_key and export APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret.



Usage

Run the Application:
text
python TradingBotPPO.py
Launches the GUI.
GUI Workflow:

Parameters: Set symbol (e.g., AAPL or BTC-USD), date range (e.g., 2022-01-01 to 2023-12-31), initial balance ($10,000 default), timesteps (100,000 default), RSI toggle, trade cost (0.001 default), and "Continue from Saved" checkbox.
Fetch Data: Downloads OHLCV data and creates the environment.
Train Model: Trains/resumes PPO (progress in log).
Test Model: Runs simulation, logs metrics (e.g., return %, trades, vs. buy-and-hold).
Plot Chart: Displays non-blocking Matplotlib window with price signals and equity curve.
Save/Load Model: Persist as ZIP (e.g., trading_model_AAPL.zip).
Log Output: Real-time console in GUI.


Example Output (from Test):
text
Final Portfolio Value: $11234.56
Return: 12.35%
Total Trades: 45
Buy & Hold Return: 8.21%
Strategy Outperformance: 4.14%
Actions: {'hold': 200, 'buy': 25, 'sell': 20}

Customization:

Edit TradingBotPPO.py for tweaks (e.g., add indicators in TradingEnv).
Hyperparameter tuning: Integrate Optuna in train_ppo_agent.
Live Trading: Uncomment Alpaca stubs (paper mode).


TensorBoard Logging:
texttensorboard --logdir ./trading_tensorboard/

Limitations & Risks

Backtesting Bias: Past performance ≠ future results; no slippage or taxes modeled.
No Real-Time Data: yfinance delayed; use Alpaca for live.
Simplified Assumptions: Fractional shares, no shorting; enhance TradingEnv.step().
Compute: GPU recommended for large timesteps (Torch auto-detects).
Legal/Financial: Not advice. Comply with SEC rules (e.g., no unregistered advisory). As a U.S. patriot, emphasize responsible use under laws like the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
